          <p className='mt-[30px]'>In the heart of Arabic culture, each meal begins with a heartfelt wish for deliciousness, health, and prosperity â€“ sentiments we embody in every plate of Mandi at our restaurant. </p>
          <p className='mt-[30px]'>Our journey commences in the ancient heart of Hadramaut, Yemen, where Mandi&apos;s secrets were first unveiled. This culinary treasure, rooted in tradition, quickly captivated the world, traveling from the Gulf to distant shores.</p>
          <p className='mt-[30px]'>Mandi, a dish known for its luscious, dew-kissed tenderness, derives its name from the Arabic word &quot;Nada,&quot; meaning &quot;dew.&quot; It&apos;s more than just a dish; it&apos;s a symbol of unity through shared meals, a bridge to our culture, and a testament to our love for tradition. It&apos;s a representation of togetherness, like a blend of all the countries in the Middle East, which we fondly refer to as &quot;Khaleej,&quot; meaning &quot;Gulf.&quot;</p>
          <p className='mt-[30px]'>Our Mandi magic unfolds in the oven, where rice and tender meats slow-cook to perfection, absorbing aromatic spices and creating a symphony of flavors. We traveled across the world to bring this sense of unity, this blend of Middle Eastern cultures, to the UK.</p>
          <p className='mt-[30px]'>&quot;Welcome to our world of Mandi, where we craft diverse flavours,tradition and togetherness of the Khaleej in perfect harmony.&quot;</p>
