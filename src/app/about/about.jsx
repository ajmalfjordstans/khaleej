          <p className='mt-[30px]'>Our journey commences in the ancient heart of Hadramaut, Yemen, where Mandi's secrets were first unveiled. This culinary treasure, rooted in tradition, quickly captivated the world, traveling from the Gulf to distant shores.</p>
          <p className='mt-[30px]'>Mandi, a dish known for its luscious, dew-kissed tenderness, derives its name from the Arabic word "Nada," meaning "dew." It's more than just a dish; it's a symbol of unity through shared meals, a bridge to our culture, and a testament to our love for tradition. It's a representation of togetherness, like a blend of all the countries in the Middle East, which we fondly refer to as "Khaleej," meaning "Gulf."</p>
          <p className='mt-[30px]'>Our Mandi magic unfolds in the oven, where rice and tender meats slow-cook to perfection, absorbing aromatic spices and creating a symphony of flavors. We traveled across the world to bring this sense of unity, this blend of Middle Eastern cultures, to the UK.</p>
          <p className='mt-[30px]'>"Welcome to our world of Mandi, where we craft diverse flavours,tradition and togetherness of the Khaleej in perfect harmony."</p>
